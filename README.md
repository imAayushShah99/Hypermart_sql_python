# 🛂 Hypermart Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **data cleaning, exploration, and SQL-based analysis** of Hypermart's sales data. The dataset was processed in **Python (VS Code, Jupyter Notebook) 🐖** and later transferred to **pgAdmin 🗃️** for SQL queries to derive business insights.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of Hypermart sales records stored in the following files:  
📄 **hypermart.csv** - Raw dataset  
🧹 **hypermart_cleaned.csv** - Cleaned dataset after preprocessing  

**📌 Dataset Source:**  
This dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**: [Hypermart 10K Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najir0123/hypermart-10k-sales-datasets/data)  

## 🔄 Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Import & Cleaning** (Python, Pandas) 🛠️  
   - Imported `hypermart.csv` in a Jupyter Notebook (`hypermart.ipynb`).  
   - Handled **missing values**, removed **duplicates**, and corrected **data types**.  
   - Exported the cleaned dataset as `hypermart_cleaned.csv`.  

2️⃣ **SQL Analysis** (PostgreSQL, pgAdmin) 🏢  
   - Loaded `hypermart_cleaned.csv` into PostgreSQL.  
   - Executed **SQL queries** in `hypermart.sql` to extract valuable business insights.  

## 🔍 Key Insights & Analysis  
✔️ Performed **data cleaning & transformation** in Python.  
✔️ Used **SQL queries** to extract insights like **top-performing products, revenue trends, and customer behavior**.  
✔️ Provided **business recommendations** based on data analysis.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- 🐖 **Languages:** SQL, Python  
- 🗃️ **Databases:** PostgreSQL  
- 📚 **Libraries:** Pandas, Requests, Matplotlib  
- 🌐 **Data Sources:** Kaggle, API  
- 📊 **Skills:** Data cleaning, date manipulation, API integration, SQL querying, data visualization
